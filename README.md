# luagray

LaTeX package for displaying the "grayness" of a file using Lua.

This package is in the early stages of development.

The code is a packaged version of one of the examples in the TUGboat article
"[Three things you can do with LuaTeX that would be extremely painful
otherwise](https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb31-3/tb99isambert.pdf)."
